# WikiArt Feature Maps

In this repo I've provided a full set of t-SNE embeddings for the wikiart dataset + a parametric t-SNE Model trained on those embeddings. Feel free to use them for art or machine learning projects.

The embeddings are built using the keras applications VGG19 convolution network pretrained on the Imagenet dataset to extract two sets of features: one generally representing content, the other style. These features are normalised, weighted and combined before running the sklearn t-SNE over them. 
Here's a diagram of the process architecture:

## Sample Images and Experiments
Here's a random sample from the wikiart dataset plotted using the provided t-SNE embeddings. Note the relatively nice clustering of similar paintings:

Please the images folder for a few more examples as well as a comparison sample generated by the parametric t-SNE model

## Roll your own Parametric t-SNE Model or Embeddings file
Creating the embeddings file or a parametric t-SNE model from scratch requires a few steps and preferably a cuda enabled GPU. 
1. The content feature representation file needs to be created - python ExtractContentFeatures.py
2. The style features file needs to be created, as well as the pca fit over the gramm matrix - python ExtractStyleFeatures.py
3. The t-SNE file can then be created from the above features - python CreateTSNEFile.py
4. A parametric t-SNE model can then be trained on the t-SNE embeddings - python LearnTSNE.py
